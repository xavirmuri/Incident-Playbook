But how do you use the insert effects in NI Massive? There are two ways to do so: before or after the filters. By default, the insert effects are applied before the filters, which means that they affect the raw sound of the oscillators. This can be useful for adding some character or harmonics to your sound before shaping it with the filters.
 
However, if you want to apply the insert effects after the filters, you need to change the routing of NI Massive. To do so, go to the routing tab and activate the second insert effect slot (INS 2). This will make both insert effects happen after the filtering stages, which means that they will affect the filtered sound of your patch. This can be useful for adding some movement or modulation to your sound after sculpting it with the filters.
 
You can also use the mix knob on each insert effect slot to blend the dry and wet signals. This way, you can control how much of the effect you want to apply to your sound. You can also use modulation sources such as envelopes, LFOs, or performers to modulate the mix knob and create dynamic effects.
 
## How to Use NI Massive Macro Controls
 
NI Massive has eight macro controls that allow you to assign multiple parameters to a single knob. This way, you can create complex changes in your sound with a simple twist of a knob. You can also automate or MIDI map the macro controls to control them from your DAW or MIDI controller.
 
But how do you use the macro controls in NI Massive? It's very easy: just drag and drop any parameter that you want to assign to a macro control onto one of the eight boxes below the macro knobs. You can assign up to 16 parameters per macro control, and you can adjust the range and direction of each parameter with the small triangles below and above each box.
 
For example, if you want to create a macro control that changes the pitch, cutoff, and resonance of your sound, you can drag and drop the pitch knob of an oscillator, the cutoff knob of a filter, and the resonance knob of another filter onto one of the macro boxes. Then, you can adjust the range and direction of each parameter according to your preference. You can also rename the macro control by double-clicking on its name and typing a new one.
 
You can use the macro controls to create expressive and versatile sounds in NI Massive. For example, you can create a macro control that morphs between different wavetables, a macro control that adds distortion and reverb to your sound, or a macro control that switches between different filter types. The possibilities are endless!
