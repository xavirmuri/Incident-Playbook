That's where the Machine Design Data Book Mahadevan comes in handy. This handbook, compiled by K. Mahadevan and K. Balaveera Reddy, is a comprehensive and updated source of design data for mechanical engineers in SI and metric units. It covers all the topics and concepts of machine design, such as:
 
- Basic principles of machine design
- Design of machine elements such as shafts, gears, bearings, springs, belts, chains, clutches, brakes, screws, fasteners, welds and joints
- Design of mechanical systems such as power transmission, fluid mechanics, heat transfer and refrigeration
- Design standards and codes such as ISO, BIS, DIN and ASME
- Design examples and problems with solutions

The Machine Design Data Book Mahadevan is based on several standard textbooks on machine design and incorporates the latest information on current design practices. It also includes many diagrams, charts and tables to illustrate the data and make it easy to understand and apply.
